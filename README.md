# CLEAN CODE
## I took these instructions from the Clean Code Book (Robert C. Martin)
### 1. Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements.
### 2. It was the bad code that brought the company down
### 3. Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
### 4. Spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of professional survival.
### 5. To defend the code with equal passion.
### 6. It will be obvious, simple, and compelling. Each module will set the stage for the next. Each tells you how the next will be written.
### 7. There is no escape from this logic. You cannot write code if you cannot read the surrounding code.
### 8. If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot.
### 9. The cleanup doesn’t have to be something big.
### 10. Change one variable name for the better, break up one function that’s a little too large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one composite if statement.
