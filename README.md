# Objects and Datas Structures
````
i. Objects: hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. 
ii. Data structure: expose their data and have no meaningful functions.

## 2. Datas Structures
### Hiding implementation:
````
Is not just a matter of putting a layer of functions between the variables.
Hiding implementation is about abstractions! A class does not simply push its variables out through getters and setters. 
Rather it exposes abstract interfaces that allow its users to manipulate the essence of the data, 
without having to know its implementation.
````
## How to choose:
### In any complex system there are going to be times when we want to add new data types rather than new functions:
````
Objects: For these cases objects and OO are most appropriate.
````
### On the other hand, there will also be times when weâ€™ll want to add new functions as opposed to data types:
Data Structures:  In that case procedural code and data structures will be more appropriate.
````
### Observation: Mature programmers know that the idea that everything is an object is a myth. Sometimes you really do want simple data structures with procedures operating on them.
