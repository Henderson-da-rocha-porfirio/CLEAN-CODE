# Comments
### 1. Don't comment bad code, rewrite it.
### 2. The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.
### 3. Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code
### 4. It takes only a few seconds of thought to explain most of your intent in code.
### 5. In many cases it’s simply a matter of creating a function that says the same thing as the comment you want to write.
### 6. TODOs are jobs that the programmer thinks should be done, but for some reason can’t do at the moment.
