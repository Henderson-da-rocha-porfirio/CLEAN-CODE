# CLEAN CODE
## I took these instructions from the Clean Code Book (Robert C. Martin)
### 1. Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements.
### 2. It was the bad code that brought the company down
### 3. Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
