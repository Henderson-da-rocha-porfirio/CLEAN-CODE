# Objects and Datas Structures
````
i. Objects: hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. 
ii. Data structure: expose their data and have no meaningful functions.

### Hiding implementation:
````
Is not just a matter of putting a layer of functions between the variables.
Hiding implementation is about abstractions! A class does not simply push its variables out through getters and setters. 
Rather it exposes abstract interfaces that allow its users to manipulate the essence of the data, 
without having to know its implementation.
