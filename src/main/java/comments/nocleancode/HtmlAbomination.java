/* HTML in source code comments is an abomination,
as you can tell by reading the code below.
It makes the comments hard to read in the one place where they should be easy to readâ€” the editor/ IDE.
If comments are going to be extracted by some tool (like Javadoc) to appear in a Web page,
then it should be the responsibility of that tool, and not the programmer,
to adorn the comments with appropriate HTML: */
