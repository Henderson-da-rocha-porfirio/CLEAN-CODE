    2. I surrounded the assignment operators with white space to accentuate them.
        Assignment statements have two distinct and major elements:
        the left side and the right side.
        The spaces make that separation obvious: */

/* 3. On the other hand, I didnâ€™t put spaces between the function names and the opening parenthesis.
        This is because the function and its arguments are closely related. Separating them makes them
        appear disjoined instead of conjoined.
        I separate arguments within the function call parenthesis to accentuate
        the comma and show that the arguments are separate.*/
