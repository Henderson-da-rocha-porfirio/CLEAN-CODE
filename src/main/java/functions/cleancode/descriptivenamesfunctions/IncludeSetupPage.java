/*Be consistent in your names. Use the same phrases, nouns, and verbs in the function names you choose for your modules. Consider, for example, the names includeSetup-AndTeardownPages, includeSetupPages, includeSuiteSetupPage, and includeSetupPage. The similar phraseology in those names allows the sequence to tell a story. Indeed, if I showed you just the sequence above, you’d ask yourself:
        “What happened to includeTeardownPages, includeSuiteTeardownPage, and includeTeardownPage?”
        How’s that for being “… pretty much what you expected.”*/
