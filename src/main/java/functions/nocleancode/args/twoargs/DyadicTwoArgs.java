/*A function with two arguments is harder to understand than a monadic function.
        For example, writeField( name) is easier to understand than writeField( output-Stream, name).
        Though the meaning of both is clear, the first glides past the eye, easily depositing its meaning.
        The second requires a short pause until we learn to ignore the first parameter.
        And that, of course, eventually results in problems because we should never ignore any part of code.
        The parts we ignore are where the bugs will hide.*/
